# Automation Testing Project

## Overview

This project is an automated testing framework built using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Maven**, **Cucumber**, and **Java**. The framework is designed to run end-to-end tests, integrating seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines to ensure the quality and reliability of web applications.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Java JDK 8 or higher**: [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **Apache Maven 3.6.0 or higher**: [Download here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **Google Chrome** (latest version) for running tests in Chrome browser
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse IDE** (Optional but recommended)

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Maven structure:

├── src │ ├── main │ │ └── java │ ├── test │ │ ├── java │ │ │ └── stepDefinitions │ │ │ └── runners │ │ │ └── utils │ │ └── resources │ │ └── features │ │ └── configs ├── pom.xml ├── README.md └── testng.xml


- **src/main/java**: Contains the core Java code (if any, like utilities).
- **src/test/java**: Contains test step definitions, runners, and utility classes.
- **src/test/resources**: Contains Cucumber feature files and configuration files.
- **pom.xml**: The Maven Project Object Model file for managing dependencies and plugins.
- **testng.xml**: TestNG suite configuration (optional, if using TestNG with Cucumber).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. **Import the project:**

Open your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse).
Import the project as a Maven project.
3.**Install dependencies:**

Maven will automatically install all required dependencies specified in the pom.xml file.
mvn clean install

### Running the Tests
Using Maven
To run the tests, execute the following command in the terminal:
mvn test

### Using TestNG (optional)
If you have a testng.xml file for more granular control over test execution:
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml

### Using Cucumber
You can also run specific Cucumber scenarios directly from the IDE using the CucumberTestRunner class or by specifying tags:
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @YourTag"

### Configuration
Browser and Environment Configuration
Browser: By default, the tests run on Chrome. To run tests on a different browser, modify the config.properties file located in src/test/resources/configs.
Environment: You can specify different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) in the config.properties file.
Example config.properties:
browser=chrome
baseUrl=https://example.com
timeout=30

### Reporting
The framework is configured to generate Cucumber reports. After running the tests, the reports will be available in the target/cucumber-reports directory.

To view the report, open the index.html file located in the target/cucumber-reports directory in your web browser.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow the standard Git workflow:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name).
Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add some feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature/your-feature-name).
Open a pull request.
